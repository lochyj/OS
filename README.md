# OS

This repository is the collation of knowledge and learnings from tutorials, wikis and others' projects. This project was started to further my knowledge of C and x86 assembly, whilst helping me understand computers at a lower level. This isn't a serious project, and it is exclusively for fun and education!

## What is the name of the OS?
I have decided to call the OS / Kernel BlinkOS
Below is the logo for the os created by https://patorjk.com/software/taag/. It is used in the boot screen of the OS.

 ```

## Building pre-requisites
- nasm
- qemu
- gcc

## Running

### Linux
    To build the kernel, you need to have qemu installed. Then run `./build.sh` in the root directory of the project.

### Windows and Mac

We currently don't have instruction for running or building on windows or mac. If you want to run it on windows or mac, you can use a virtual machine, or a future unimplemented docker version. Additionally, Windows 10+ users can use WSL. I recommend Arch or Ubuntu distros.
